Extdata extension for Pigeonhole Sieve

Introduction
------------

Sieve (RFC 5228) is a highly extsible machine language specifically tailored for
internet message filtering. For the Dovecot Secure IMAP server, Sieve support is
provided by the Pigeonhole Sieve plugin. This package extends the Sieve filtering
implementation with an extension to support retrieving string values from external 
sources.  The extension supplies a new test so that external data can be examined. 
When the variables extension (RFC5229) is also active, the external data can also
be accessed from a special variables namespace.

This extension is specific to the Pigeonhole Sieve implementation for the Dovecot
Secure IMAP server.  It will therefore most likely not be supported by web 
interfaces or GUI-based Sieve editors.  This extension is primarily meant for use 
in global scripts that are managed by the systems administrator.
