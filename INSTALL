Compiling
---------

If you downloaded this package using Mercurial, you have a script called 
autogen.sh in your source tree. You should execute that first:

./autogen.sh

After this executed successfully or when you downloaded the tarball,
configure needs to be executed with the following parameters:

  --with-dovecot=<path>
    Path to the dovecot-config file. This can either be a compiled dovecot
    source tree or point to the location where the dovecot-config file is
    installed on your system (typically in the $prefix/lib/dovecot 
    directory).

  --with-pigeonhole=<path>	
    Path to the Pigeonhole headers. If the --with-dovecot parameter points
    to the path where dovecot-config is installed, this parameter is 
    usually not necessary. This parameter may either point to the a
    Pigeonhole source tree or the location where the Pigeonhole headers 
    are installed on your system.

For example, when compiling against sources:

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-1.2 \
  --with-pigeonhole=../dovecot-1.2-sieve

Or when compiling against a Dovecot installation:

./configure --with-dovecot=/usr/local/lib/dovecot/

As usual, to compile and install, execute the following:

make
sudo make install 

Configuration
-------------

This package builds and installs the sieve_extdata plugin for Pigeonhole
Sieve. The plugin is activated by adding it to the sieve_plugins setting:

sieve_plugins = sieve_extdata

The following configuration settings are used:

sieve_extdata_dict_uri =
  Specifies the uri of the dict that is used for extdata lookups.

Example:

plugin {
  sieve = ~/.dovecot.sieve

  sieve_plugins = sieve_extdata

  sieve_extdata_dict_uri = file:/etc/pigeonhole-sieve.dict
}
