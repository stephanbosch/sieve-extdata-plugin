             Sieve Email Filtering: External Data Extension

Abstract

   In advanced mail filtering setups, it is often convenient to store
   configuration data in an external data store.  This document updates
   the Sieve filtering language (RFC 5228) with an extension to support
   retrieving string values from external sources.  The extension
   supplies a new test so that external data can be examined.  When the
   variables extension (RFC5229) is also active, the external data can
   also be accessed from a special variables namespace.

                      Sieve External Data Extension         January 2010


1.  Introduction

   This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by SIEVE
   [RFC5228].  It adds support for referencing externally stored named
   data.  In the Sieve base specification such data can only be made
   available in a Sieve script by including it statically in the Sieve
   script itself.  This extension adds a new test command to retrieve
   and evaluate data items stored externally.  When the Sieve Variables
   extension [RFC5229] is also active, a special variables namespace is
   available through which the data items can be accessed more
   conveniently for string substitution.

   This extension is specific to the Pigeonhole Sieve implementation for
   the Dovecot Secure IMAP server.  It will therefore most likely not be
   supported by web interfaces and GUI-based ManageSieve clients.  This
   extension is primarily meant for use in global scripts that are
   managed by the systems administrator.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Conventions for notations are as in SIEVE [RFC5228] Section 1.1.


3.  Capability Identifier

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "vnd.dovecot.extdata".


4.  Naming of Data Items

   In the simplest case, i.e. when the implementation is restricted to
   only one distinct data store or when the source of the data item has
   no significance, the name of an external data item MAY be a simple
   identifier as defined in the SIEVE [RFC5228] grammar.

   When multiple distinct data stores are available, the item name MUST
   be structured hierarchically just like the variables namespace syntax
   defined in VARIABLES [RFC5229], with the restriction that numeric
   (num-variable) elements are not allowed.  The first element of a
   hierarchical item name identifies the data store and subsequent
   elements identify the data item within that data store.  This yields
   the following syntax for a hierarchical data item name:



Bosch                                                           [Page 2]

                      Sieve External Data Extension         January 2010


   item-name         =  data-store-name "." identifier *("." identifier)
   data-store-name   =  identifier


5.  Extdata Test

   Usage:   extdata [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                    <item-name: string>
                    <key-list: string-list>

   The extdata test retrieves the data item specified by the item-name
   string from the external data store and matches it to the values
   specified in the key-list argument.  The specified item-name MUST
   conform to the syntax defined in Section 4.  The test succeeds if a
   match occurs.  The type of match defaults to ":is" and the default
   comparator is "i;ascii-casemap".

   The extdata test MUST fail unconditionally if the specified data item
   cannot be retrieved, e.g. because it does not exist in the external
   data store or when the data store is not available.  A script MUST
   NOT fail with an error if the item cannot be retrieved.  This allows
   scripts to be written that handle nonexistent items gracefully.  In
   particular, the test:

     if extdata :contains "item" "" { ... }

   only fails if the "item" does not exists in the data store or when
   the data store is not available, and always succeeds otherwise.

   The "relational" extension [RFC5231] adds a match type called
   ":count".  The count of an extdata test is 0 if the extdata
   information returned is the empty string, or 1 otherwise.


6.  Variables Namespace extdata

   This document defines the variables namespace "extdata", as specified
   in VARIABLES [RFC5229], Section 3.  The extdata namespace provides
   direct access to the data items in the external data store.

   Example:

   require ["vacation", "variables", "vnd.dovecot.extdata"];

   vacation :subject "${extdata.vacation_subject}"
            "${extdata.vacation_message}";

   External data items accessed via the extdata test and the extdata



Bosch                                                           [Page 3]

   variables namespace MUST be one and the same.  The following example
   scripts are equivalent:

   Example 1:

   require ["fileinto", "variables", "vnd.dovecot.extdata"];

   if allof (header :is "X-Spam-Status" "Yes",
     extdata :is "discard_spam" "yes") {
     discard;
   } else {
     fileinto "Spam";
   }

   Example 2:

   require ["fileinto", variables", "vnd.dovecot.extdata"];

   if allof (header :is "X-Spam-Status" "Yes",
     string :is "${extdata.discard_spam}" "yes") {
     discard;
   } else {
     fileinto "Spam";
   }

   The extdata namespace accepts any data item name.  A script MUST NOT
   fail with an error when a data item is referenced that does not exist
   in the external data store or otherwise cannot be retrieved.  In that
   case the empty string will be substituted, which is analogous to the
   substitution of unset normal variables.  Use the extdata test to
   evaluate wether a data item exists and can be retrieved.

   This extension only concerns the retrieval of external data items and
   therefore it is not possible to assign values to items within the
   extdata variables namespace using for example the "set" action
   defined in VARIABLES [RFC5229].  A script MUST fail with an error
   when an attempt is made to assign to an item in the extdata
   namespace.

8.  Security Considerations

   Administrators should keep in mind that retrieving values from an

   external data store can reveal more data to a user than strictly
   allowed when the data store is not queried carefully.
